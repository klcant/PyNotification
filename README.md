PyNotification
==============

Python script(s) used to send notifications via SMTP, GTalk, and SMS.

I will keep the separate scripts so that you can do each part by alone (as well as have a combined script).

Requirements:

- xmpp.py http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/
- Google Account - I use google for my scripts, but you should be able to get the SMTP and SMS to work with any provider.
